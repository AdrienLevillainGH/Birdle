<h1>How to Play BirdL</h1>

<p>
BirdL is a daily bird guessing game inspired by Wordle, similar to 'Birdle' or 'Birdie'.
Each day, one mystery bird is selected from a curated global dataset.
You have 10 guesses to find it using ecological and biological hints
revealed after each attempt.
</p>

<h2>Game objective</h2>
<p>
Your goal is to identify the mystery bird in 10 attempts.
BirdL is designed for both novice and experienced bird enthusiasts,
encouraging exploration and discovery rather than penalizing mistakes.
</p>

<h2>How guessing works</h2>
<p>
After each guess, BirdL reveals clues about the mystery bird’s
characteristics, such as:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Habitat</li>
  <li>Diet</li>
  <li>Migration strategy</li>
  <li>Taxonomy and morphology</li>
</ul>

<p>
Each new guess helps you narrow down the possible species.
There are no wrong answers — only birds to discover.
</p>

<h2>Daily puzzle</h2>
<p>
BirdL resets every day at UTC midnight.
A new mystery bird is available daily, giving players a fresh
challenge every 24 hours.
